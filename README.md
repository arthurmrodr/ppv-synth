# Impact Evaluation of Pacto Pela Vida using Synthetic Control Security Intervention

This is a brief exploration on Synthetic Control methods in R. For that, I study the implementation of Pacto Pela Vida (a result-based management program in public security) in Brazilian State of Pernambuco.

* Relevant Synthetic Control papers are available in '/papers'

* Tutorial of Synth R package available [here](https://rpubs.com/danilofreire/synth). Examples of its implementation available [here](https://mixtape.scunning.com/10-synthetic_control), [here](https://lost-stats.github.io/Model_Estimation/Research_Design/synthetic_control_method.html) and [here](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/15-Synthetic-Control.html).
